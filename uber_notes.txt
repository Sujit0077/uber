1. Load and Explore Data
Load the data from a CSV file.
Check the first few rows to understand the dataset.
Get summary statistics and information about the data (e.g., number of rows, columns, and data types).
2. Preprocess Data
Drop unnecessary columns (like Unnamed: 0, key).
Extract useful information (like month and hour) from the pickup_datetime column.
Handle missing values by replacing them with the average of that column.
3. Calculate Distance
Calculate the distance between pickup and dropoff locations using the Haversine formula (based on latitude and longitude).
4. Handle Zero and Negative Values
Replace zeros in certain columns with the average value of that column (e.g., passenger_count, distance).
Fix negative or zero fare values by replacing them with the average fare amount.
5. Remove Outliers
Detect and remove outliers by clipping values that are too high or too low based on IQR (Interquartile Range).
6. Visualize Data
Use boxplots to visualize and detect outliers.
Use a heatmap to show the correlation between different features.
7. Split Data
Separate the features (X) and target variable (fare amount, y).
Split the data into training and testing sets (80% for training, 20% for testing).
8. Train Models
Train a Linear Regression model on the training data.
Train a Random Forest model on the same training data.
9. Make Predictions
Predict the fare amount using both models (Linear Regression and Random Forest).
10. Evaluate Models
Compare the models using performance metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared (RÂ²).
11. Show Results
Display a few actual vs predicted values to see how well the models performed.
